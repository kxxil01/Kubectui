## Keybindings

### Navigation

| Key | Action |

| `Enter` | Expand/collapse group or navigate to view |

> Tip: focus switches automatically to the content list when you select a view. Press `Esc` to return focus to the sidebar.

### Content list

### Global

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `~` | Open namespace picker |
| `c` | Open context switcher |
| `:` | Open command palette |
| `T` | Cycle color theme (dark → nord → dracula → catppuccin) |
| `q` | Quit (asks for confirmation) |
| `Esc` | Cancel quit confirmation / close overlays |

---

## Detail View

Press `Enter` on any resource to open its detail view. The detail view shows metadata, status, resource-specific info, metrics (where available), and a YAML preview.

### Detail view keybindings

| Key | Action | Applies to |
|-----|--------|------------|
| `l` / `L` | Open log viewer | Pods |
| `f` | Open port-forward dialog | Pods |
| `s` | Open scale dialog | Deployments, StatefulSets |
| `p` | Open probe inspector | Pods |
| `R` | Rollout restart | Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets |
| `e` | Edit YAML in `$EDITOR` | All (when YAML is loaded) |
| `d` | Delete resource (with confirmation) | All |
| `Esc` | Close detail view | All |

---

## Log Viewer

Open with `l` from a Pod detail view.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Scroll down one line |
| `k` / `↑` | Scroll up one line |
| `g` | Jump to top |
| `G` | Jump to bottom |
| `f` | Toggle follow mode (auto-scroll to new lines) |
| `Esc` | Close log viewer |

> Tip: follow mode streams new log lines in real time. Toggle it off with `f` to freely scroll history.

---

## Port-Forward Dialog

Open with `f` from a Pod detail view. Pre-fills namespace and pod name automatically.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Move to next field |
| `Shift+Tab` | Move to previous field |
| `Enter` | Create tunnel |
| `F2` | Switch to tunnel list view |
| `Esc` | Close dialog |

**In tunnel list view:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Select next tunnel |
| `k` / `↑` | Select previous tunnel |
| `d` | Stop selected tunnel |
| `r` | Refresh tunnel list |
| `F1` | Switch back to create form |
| `Esc` | Close dialog |

> Tip: set local port to `0` to auto-assign a free port.

---

## Scale Dialog

Open with `s` from a Deployment or StatefulSet detail view.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `0`–`9` | Type desired replica count |
| `+` | Increment by 1 |
| `-` | Decrement by 1 |
| `Backspace` | Delete last digit |
| `Enter` | Apply scale |
| `Esc` | Cancel |

> Tip: a warning appears if you change replicas by more than 10 at once. Valid range is 0–100.

---

## Probe Inspector

Open with `p` from a Pod detail view. Shows liveness and readiness probe configs for each container.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Select next container |
| `k` / `↑` | Select previous container |
| `Space` | Expand/collapse container probe details |
| `Esc` | Close inspector |

---

## Rollout Restart

Press `R` (shift+r) from a Deployment, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet detail view. Triggers a rolling restart by patching the pod template annotation — equivalent to `kubectl rollout restart`. No confirmation prompt; takes effect immediately.

---

## Namespace Picker

Press `~` from anywhere to open the namespace picker.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Move down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move up |
| `Enter` | Select namespace |
| `Esc` | Cancel |

Select `all` to show resources across all namespaces.

---

## Context Switcher

Press `c` from the main view (or select at startup if multiple contexts exist).

| Key | Action |

| `j` / `↓` | Move down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move up |
| `Enter` | Switch to selected context |
| `Esc` | Cancel |

## Command Palette

Press `:` to open. Type any resource name to jump directly to that view.

| Key | Action |

| Type | Filter views by name |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate results |
| `Enter` | Navigate to selected view |
| `Esc` | Close |

---

## Themes

KubecTUI ships with 5 color themes. Press `T` (shift+t) from the main view to cycle through them. The current theme is shown in the status bar.

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dark` | GitHub-inspired deep dark (default) |
| `nord` | Arctic, north-bluish color palette |
| `dracula` | Dark with vibrant purple/pink accents |
| `catppuccin` | Warm dark with pastel accents (Mocha variant) |
| `light` | Clean, high-contrast light background |

Your theme choice is saved automatically to `~/.config/kubectui/config.json` and restored on next launch.

### CLI flag

```bash
kubectui --theme nord
```

Valid values: `dark`, `nord`, `dracula`, `catppuccin`, `mocha`, `light`.

## Tips

- **Quick jump**: use `:` + type `dep` to jump straight to Deployments, `pod` for Pods, etc.
- **Search is live**: `/` filters the current list as you type — no need to press Enter.
- **Ctrl+U** clears the search query while in search mode.
- **Helm releases**: navigate to Helm → Releases to see all Helm v3 releases in the cluster. No Helm CLI needed.
- **Metrics**: CPU/memory metrics in the detail view require `metrics-server` to be installed in the cluster. If unavailable, a note is shown instead of an error.
- **YAML view**: every resource detail view includes a YAML preview at the bottom — useful for quick inspection without switching to a terminal.
- **Restart vs Scale**: use `R` for a rolling restart (zero-downtime pod replacement), use `s` to change the replica count.
